    Jenny and I are both from Vancouver, but we started dating right after she moved to San Francisco and did long distance for almost two years. I spent many weekends in the Bay Area so it was a special place to me as it was where I fell in love with her. In the first month of dating, as we were discussing our shared love of food, she mentioned there was a 3 Michelin star restaurant (The French Laundry) in Napa, and I told her I’d bring her there one day, with a big emphasis on the ‘one day,’ joking that it’d be when we were old. But I already knew then that it wouldn’t be that far away, and that when it happened, it would be for this.
    <br><br>
    Time went on and she moved back to Vancouver and we were still going on many adventures but we hadn’t been back to SF together in a while. I planned out a trip for us to visit SF many months in advance for her birthday and made reservations at The French Laundry. I tried to make it a surprise but it was leaked by a friend, which turned out for the better as I did not have an excuse to explain why I would be wearing a suit. On the day of, what I soon found out was even with all the planning in the world things don’t always go as smoothly. On the way to The French Laundry I slipped going down some stairs and the heel of my shoe came right off!! Already stressed and nervous, this added to my anxiety as I tried to repair my shoe quickly. To no avail I decided I couldn’t fix it and hoped no one would notice.

    As we approached the restaurant, Jenny wanted to take lots of photos. As I knew there was a photographer was hiding and waiting for us, I reluctantly obliged so she wouldn’t be suspicious. As we arrived in front of The French Laundry’s iconic blue door a million things ran through my head, “Will the photographer see us, will anyone notice my shoe and how to conceal it while proposing, and who are these people in front of the door... Wait who are these random people are standing in front of the door?!” Jenny saw it as an opportunity to get our photo taken and I saw it as people blocking the photographer’s shots. We got our photos taken by those random people and as Jenny was looking over the photos I decided I had to do it before any other interruptions could occur. I got down on one knee, pulled out the ring and proposed! At that moment nothing else seemed to matter, just that she said yes!!
